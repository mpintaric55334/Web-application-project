# Web-application-project
Project done at 3rd year of college, fully functional web application

This project was done for Program Engineering course, team of 7 students.
It was done using Spring Boot and Java for backend, and React JS for frontend.
I was doing backend with 2 fellow students.
The app and database were hosted on Render, using free option.
Site can be visited on this link https://sinappsafront.onrender.com/ , but may take up to 10 minutes to load because of the free plan we used, also, the database may be empty because Render deletes free databases every 90 days
